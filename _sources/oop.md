# Object Oriented Programming

**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

The universe presents itself as a collection of objects that humans (in particular, scientists)tend to classify based on their attributes and behaviors. Similarities, relationships, and hierarchies among these objects further help to structure our perception of the world. In alignment with that conceptual model, object orientation facilitates representation of the world as classes of objects that possess attributes, behaviors, and hierarchical relationships. Classes in object orientation organize data, methods, and functions. Those classes manifest themselves as specific objects. We will discuss these two concepts in great detail here.


Object-Oriented Programming:
 * **Abstraction:**  Basic features of an object like attributes and behaviour
 * **Encapsulation:**  binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data at the same abstraction element or class. 
 * **Hiding:**  Prevents  external  code  from  being  concerned  with  the  internal workings  of  an  object.  This  facilitates  code  refactoring,  for  example allowing  the  author  of  the  class  to  change  how  objects  of  that  class represent their data internally without changing any external code.
 * **Inheritance:**  This  allows  classes  to  be  arranged  in  a  hierarchy  that represents "is-a-type-of" relationships. 
 * **Polymorphism:** when calling code can be agnostic as to which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on - the parent class or one of its descendants. Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently.
