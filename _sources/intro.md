# Re-using code/Programming Paradigms

In this jupyter book we study how to write re-useable programs (scripts) and two paradigms of code style and organization: Modular programming and Object Oriented Programming (OOP), specially the latter:

- Modular (or Procedural) programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

- Object Oriented Programmig is a coding method that entails the use of objects and their relationships in order to describe, programmatically, the problem to be solved.


The topics covered are the following:

1. Scripts.

2. Modular programming.

3. Object Oriented Programming.

    a. Definition.
    
    b. Objects and classes.
    
    c. Polymorphism
    
    d. Inheritance and Composition.

This book does not try to cover in detail the topics. The aim is to introduce the reader to these concepts. The reader is encouraged to read the documentation for more information.
