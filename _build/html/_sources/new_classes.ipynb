Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Like integers or strings but more complex. \n",

    "A **Class** is the abstract representation of a concept, like dog, integer number, person, etc ... It doesn’t contain any data. On the other hand, an **instance** is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. Let see an example:"
